The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. These are failure cases of the trucks during operation, and our task is to predict whether a given failure is caused due to a specific component of the Air Pressure System. This may help in avoiding failure during truck operation and thereby reducing maintenance cost.
